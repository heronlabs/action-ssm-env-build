## Working with this repo (managed by /init — edits between these markers are overwritten on re-init)

- **Edit, don't rewrite.** Change only the needed entry in a config/generated file (`package.json`, lockfiles, manifests, CI yaml); preserve the rest. Never regenerate a whole file to add one line.
- **No scope creep.** Build only what was asked; no speculative abstractions, layers, or options. Prefer the simplest working solution.
- **Ambiguous literals: flag, don't guess.** Config keys, IDs, and env names can be literal values, not mappings. State which reading you took.
- **Scope a change to where it belongs** — most changes are localized to one area; touch other repos only when the change genuinely cuts across, and then update the related repos too.
